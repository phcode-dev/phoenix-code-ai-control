# Phoenix Code AI Control

üîê Control AI features in Phoenix Code with deployment scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux ‚Äî made for schools and enterprise setups.

## Overview

Phoenix Code AI Control provides system administrators and users with tools to manage AI functionality in educational and enterprise environments. This repository contains:

- Installation scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Browser detection for AI availability

## Installation

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux
- Administrative access for system-wide installation
- Phoenix Code Desktop or Browser version

### Desktop Installation Scripts

Download and run the appropriate script for your platform:

- [Windows Script](https://download.phcode.dev/ai-control/setup_phoenix_ai_control_win.bat)
- [macOS Script](https://download.phcode.dev/ai-control/setup_phoenix_ai_control_mac.sh)
- [Linux Script](https://download.phcode.dev/ai-control/setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh)

#### Windows Installation

1. Download the Windows script
2. Right-click and select "Run as administrator"
3. Follow the on-screen prompts

#### macOS Installation

1. Download the macOS script
2. Open Terminal and navigate to your download location
3. Run: `chmod +x setup_phoenix_ai_control_mac.sh`
4. Execute: `sudo ./setup_phoenix_ai_control_mac.sh`

#### Linux Installation

1. Download the Linux script
2. Open Terminal and navigate to your download location
3. Run: `chmod +x setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh`
4. Execute: `sudo ./setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh`

## Installation Script CLI Options

All installation scripts support the same command-line options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--help` | Display usage information and help text |
| `--managedByEmail <email>` | Admin email who manages AI policy. Can be used in your Phoenix managed AI dashboard to selectively enable features and manage usage quotas |
| `--allowedUsers <user1,user2,...>` | Comma-separated list of usernames allowed to use AI even when disabled for others |
| `--disableAI` | If present, AI will be disabled by default for all users except those specified in `allowedUsers` |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Enable AI with administrative contact
sudo ./setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh --managedByEmail admin@example.com

# Enable AI for specific users only
sudo ./setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh --allowedUsers alice,bob --disableAI

# Complete setup with all options
sudo ./setup_phoenix_ai_control_linux.sh --managedByEmail admin@example.com --allowedUsers alice,bob --disableAI
```

### Configuration File Locations

The scripts create configuration files in the following system-wide locations:

- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Phoenix AI Control\config.json`
- **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Phoenix AI Control/config.json`
- **Linux**: `/etc/phoenix-ai-control/config.json`

These files are created with read-only permissions for regular users and can only be modified by administrators.

## Verifying AI Control Status

### In Desktop App

1. Open Phoenix Code
2. Navigate to File ‚Üí Check AI Control Status
3. A dialog will appear showing your current configuration:
   - AI Status (Enabled/Disabled)
   - Platform information
   - Current user
   - Managed by (administrative contact)
   - List of allowed users (if configured)

### In Browser Version

1. Open Phoenix Code in your web browser
2. Navigate to File ‚Üí Check AI Control Status
3. The browser will check if `ai.phcode.dev` is accessible:
   - First shows "Checking if AI is disabled..."
   - Then displays whether AI is available or blocked
   - Provides information on firewall configuration

## Configuration Options

### Network Blocking (Recommended for Schools)

The simplest way to disable AI functionality is to block access to:
- `ai.phcode.dev`

Add this domain to your firewall or content filtering system. The browser version of Phoenix Code will automatically detect if the domain is unreachable.

### User-Level Control (Desktop Only)

For more granular control on desktop installations:

1. The installation scripts create a configuration file at a system-wide location
2. This file contains:
   - `disableAI`: Boolean flag to control global AI access
   - `managedByEmail`: Optional administrative contact
   - `allowedUsers`: Optional array of usernames with AI access
3. Only administrative users can modify this configuration

## FAQ

### How do I know if AI control is working?

In both the desktop and browser versions, go to File ‚Üí Check AI Control Status to see a detailed report.

### Can I allow specific users to access AI features?

Yes, but only in the desktop version. Use the `--allowedUsers` parameter with a comma-separated list of usernames when running the installation script. These users will be able to access AI features even when disabled system-wide with the `--disableAI` flag.

### What's the difference between browser and desktop control?

- **Browser Control**: Limited to network-level blocking of `ai.phcode.dev`
- **Desktop Control**: Supports both network blocking and fine-grained user permissions through the configuration file

### Is AI control mandatory?

No, AI control is optional and meant for educational institutions or enterprises that need to regulate AI usage. By default, all users have access to AI features.

### Will blocking AI affect other Phoenix Code features?

No, all other features of Phoenix Code will continue to work normally. Only the AI-powered features like code generation and explanations will be affected.

### How can I update the AI control configuration?

Simply run the installation script again with the new parameters. The script will overwrite the existing configuration file with your new settings.

### Does this completely prevent AI usage?

For the desktop version, the control is comprehensive when properly configured. For the browser version, you must implement network-level blocking of the `ai.phcode.dev` domain to effectively control access.

### How can I verify that the firewall is properly blocking AI access?

In the browser version, use the "Check AI Control Status" option which will attempt to connect to the AI service and report whether it's accessible or blocked.
